## Intro

They had recently shifted their warehouse access management system to a blockchain-based solution to improve security and transparency. The company operated two main warehouses, ElectroHub and AgroCenter, each with its own set of access permissions.With different permissions different access levels of the warehouses can be accesed that are managed by the SecureStore contract, allowing for finer-grained control over who can access what in the system. The warehouse access control system was designed to provide clients with the ability to securely access their storage units and monitor the flow of goods.
